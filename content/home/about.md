# Biography

Jason is the library assistant for electronic resources working in the [Acquisitions and Collection Development Department](//library.lmu.edu/) at Loyola Marymount University. 

My work focuses on the maintance of all electronic resources (monographs, databases, and steaming media). To that end, my [workshops](#publications) and [presentations](#presentations) are often designed as hands-on experiences where you can download practice data, presentation slides, and workbook guides so that you can learn at your own pace. Any coding provided here has been learned through on-the-job usage and is shared for the purpose of helping others with similar needs. Public projects shared on this site (without a login creditial) can be forked and used at other institutions without attribution.
